    <h1>Hey there! I am Julia, an UX/UI designer based in Berlin</h1>

    <div class="Aboutme">
        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>To today, I was lucky to gain insights into large corporates, research institutions, startups, and incubators. Across those different settings, I became convinced that only empathetic and user-focused decisions lead to sustainable success.Personally, I have been most successful collaborating on the design and development of solutions that are aligned with my personal values: diversity, growth, and determination. Thus, I am currently tackling the digital talent gap at Ironhack while growing my own skills with an immersive UX/UI design part-time training.Applying the essentials of Design Thinking and successfully managing large scale projects, I am always seeking opportunities to grow and drive an inclusive digital future. </p>
